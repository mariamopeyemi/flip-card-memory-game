## flip-card-memory-game
#Welcome to the Memory game, here are the rules:
The entire card will be revealed for few seconds afterwhich it will be overlaid.
You have to flip over a card and another till you get a match.
If there is a match; you have a point.
If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back
The game continues until you match all the cards on the board.
Upon completion you get an alert that declares you a star.

This was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
